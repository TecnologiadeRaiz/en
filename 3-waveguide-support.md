# Waveguide support design

In the research to obtain a support design, we considered:

- Lightweight.
- As few materials as possible.
- That it has the versatility to be able to adapt to smaller or larger pipes.
- The material used should be durable and compatible with the antenna material.
- That it is easy to reproduce.
